My Java Locker System Application

What Does It Do? (Features)
This application lets users:

Rent a Locker: Automatically assigns the next available locker and generates a unique, 4-digit PIN (which includes leading zeros!).
Access a Rented Locker: Users can open a locker by providing its number and the correct PIN.
Release (Un-rent) a Locker: Users can free up a locker by providing the correct number and PIN, but it requires a confirmation step to prevent accidental releases.
How It's Built (Project Structure)
I've learned to break this project down into several classes, each with its own job. This makes the code much cleaner and easier to manage, even though it felt confusing at first!
Main.java (The Boss): This is where the whole application starts. It sets up all the other parts (managers), displays the main menu, and tells the right manager what to do based on user choices. It's just the coordinator, not doing the detailed work itself.
IO.java (The Communicator): This class handles all talking with the user. If the app needs to print a message or ask for input (like a locker number or PIN), it does it through IO. This keeps all the System.out.println and Scanner stuff in one place!
Locker.java (The Blueprint): This is the basic design for one single locker. It defines what a locker is (its number, its PIN, if it's rented) and how to get or change that specific locker's information.
LockerService.java (The Manager): This class is in charge of the entire collection of lockers. It creates all the lockers when the app starts, generates those random 4-digit PINs, and handles the logic for renting a locker.
LockerAccessMG.java (The Security Guard): This class handles all the security checks. It verifies if a user has the right locker number and PIN to either access (open) or release (un-rent) a locker.

Coming from merchant services, stepping into software development felt like jumping into the deep end of the ocean. For the past two weeks, honestly, I've often felt like I had no idea what I was doing(I still dont), even after learning about variables, loops, classes, methods, constructors, getter and setters and all that stuff. It was so hard to see how all the pieces fit together.

The biggest struggle was trying to connect everything. It felt like I knew all the words, but couldn't write a sentence. Concepts like static, using this., passing arguments between classes, and understanding why one method needs to call another were really tough. That i + 1 for array indexing? Felt impossible.
And breaking down a big problem into tiny, tiny steps has been crucial. Every time I fixed an error (and there were many!), it was a small victory that taught me something new.

I'm learning that programming isn't just about knowing syntax; it's about a whole new way of thinking and problem-solving, breaking big things into small, manageable parts. It's been frustrating, but also incredibly rewarding when a piece of code finally clicks and works as expected. I'm really grateful for the guidance that helped me through the tough spots.

I'm starting to see the power of "putting it all together"  I know I need a lot more practice.

What's Next for Me
My goal is to do this 100 more times! After this Locker System, I want to build more projects to solidify my understanding through repetition and different challenges. Bring on the next one!
